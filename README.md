# summer-project-2016
A repository containing a summary of the work I did in the summer of 2016 at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, Dresden. The project was based on the theoretical calculation of the RKKY exchange interaction in f-electron intermetallics with modified form factor.
